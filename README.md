This repository is for examples of Stencila Documents and Sheets. Contributions and ideas welcome!

- [`hello-world`](hello-world): a simple 'Hello world' document repeated using alternative formats supported by Stencila
- [`mtcars`](mtcars): yet another R "mtcars" example illustrating use of a range input to create an adjustable plot
- [`chinook`](chinook): analyzing data from a digital media store using SQLite and R
- [`diamonds`](diamonds): illustrates how data can be passed between multiple languages embedded within a single document
- [`rodents`](rodents): mimics a (very small) journal article embedding figures and tables generated using R

Stencila is still in early beta. You can download and open these documents using the [Stencila Desktop](https://github.com/stencila/desktop/releases). We :heart: your feedback and pull requests! Please note that support for many of file formats in this repository (e.g. RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebooks) is proof-of-concept only. We will do further work on the implementations of converters for these formats once Stencila's internal format is finalised.
